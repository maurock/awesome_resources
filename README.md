# Great resources
This is my not-exhaustive collection of the best resources on Machine learning I find. I will try to update this constantly. Suggestions are very much appreciated!

## Reinforcement Learning
- [Dissecting Reinforcement Learning - Series (M. Patacchiola's blog)](https://mpatacchiola.github.io/blog/2016/12/09/dissecting-reinforcement-learning.html): introductory lectures on Reinforcement Learning. Code is provided and explained for every step. Very interesting overview on the intersection between RL and neuroscience.
- [Henry AI RL series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SLGEq_HZxk&list=PLnn6VZp3hqNvRrdnMOVtgV64F_O-61C1D): series through the Introduction to Reinforcement Learning book (Sutton and Barto)

## Bayesian ML
- [Bayesian methods - Series (M. Patacchiola's blog)](https://mpatacchiola.github.io/blog/2020/07/31/gaussian-mixture-models.html): introduction on hierarchical Bayesian methods (MLE, MAP, Full bayesian, GMM, etc..). 

## Mathemathics for ML
- [There and Back Again: A Tale of Slopes and Expectations](https://mml-book.github.io/slopes-expectations.html): NeurIPS tutorial on integration, calculus and stochastic sampling useful for variational inference, parameterised inference, Monte Carlo methods, etc.. 
- [Mathematics for Machine learning](https://mml-book.github.io/): book by Marc Peter Deisenroth, A. Aldo Faisal, and Cheng Soon Ong.
- [Statistics 110](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbB0FjPg0mw&list=PL2SOU6wwxB0uwwH80KTQ6ht66KWxbzTIo): Lecture videos by Joe Blitzstein (Harvard)

## Blogs
- [Probably Overthinking It](https://www.allendowney.com/blog/): bi-monthly(ish) blog on Data science, statistics, Bayesian inference and causality by Allen Downey. The author also wrote the books [Think Bayes, or Think Python](https://greenteapress.com/wp/), also available for free!
- [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/): posts from different authors, mainly on causality, Bayesian statistics, rationality, philosophy and [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/)


## Writing
- [LaTeX Math Symbols](https://kapeli.com/cheat_sheets/LaTeX_Math_Symbols.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/index)
- [Writing in the sciences](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sciwrite): Coursera course offered by Standford on scientific writing.

## Others
- [Machine Learning Tokyo Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Machine-Learning-Tokyo): Weekly meetups on Machine learning, mathematics, awesome events, etc..
- [Henry AI Lab Weekly AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7FdHjaDMNA&t=188s): a ~35 minutes weekly update on AI every Monday.The author also skims over new papers or speak about cool talks held during the past week.
